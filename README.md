# DBMS
## Data Base Management System
DBMS are software systes used to store, retrieve, and run quries on data. A DBMS serves as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to CRUD, operation Create, Read, Update and Delete.

DBMS manages the data, the database engine and the database scheme, allowing for data to be manipluatedor extracted by users and other programs. This helps provide dta scurity, data integrity, concurrrency and uniform data adminstration procedures.

DBMS optimizes the organization of data by following a database schema design technique called normalization, which splits a large table into smaller tables when any of its attributes have redundancy in values. DBMS offer many benefits over traditional file systems, including flexibilty and a more complex backup system.

Database management systems can be classified based on variety of criteria such as the data model, the database distribution , or user numbers. the most widely used types of DBMS software are relational,distributed, hierarchical, object-oriented, and network.

## Relational DataBases Management System (RDBMS)
Relational databases management sytem are the most popular data model because of its user-friendly interface. It is based on normalizing data in the rows and columns of the tables. This is a vialable option when you need a data storage system that is scalable, flexiable and able to manage lots of information

## Distributed DataBase Mangement System
A distributrd DBMS is a set of logically interrelated databases distributed over a network that is managed by a centralized databaes application.This is type of DBMS synchronizes data periodically and ensures that any change to data is universally in the database.

## Hierarchical DataBase Mangement System
Hierarchical databases organize model data in a tree-like structure. Data storage is either aa top -down or bottom-up format and is represented using a parent-hild relationship.

## Distributed Database Management System
A Distributed DBMS  is a set of logically interrelated databases distributed over  network that is managed by a centralized database application. This type of DBMS synchronizes data periodically and ensures that any change to data is universally updated in the database.
